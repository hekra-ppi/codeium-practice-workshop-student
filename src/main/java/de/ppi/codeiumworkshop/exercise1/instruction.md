# Exercise 1: Auto Completion

## Objective

Implement a Java class `Employee` with properties `name`, `age`, `email`, `position`, and `salary`. Utilize Codeium's auto-completion to generate getter and setter methods as well as additional methods for business logic.

## Task Instructions

1. **Create the `Employee` Class:**
    - Define the properties: `name`, `age`, `email`, `position`, and `salary`.
    - Implement the constructor to initialize these properties.

2. **Generate Getter and Setter Methods:**
    - Use Codeium's auto-completion feature to generate getter and setter methods for each property.

3. **Implement Additional Methods:**
    - `promote`: A method to promote the employee to a new position with a salary increase in percentage.
    - `getEmployeeDetails`: A method to return a formatted string containing the employee's details.

4. **Override `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString`:**
    - Use Codeium to assist in overriding these methods for better object comparison and debugging.
    - `email` is a unique identifier for each employee. Make sure to use the `email` property in your `equals` and `hashCode` methods.
