# Exercise 2: Code Explanation and Refactoring

## Objective

Analyze and document the functionality of a provided sorting algorithm class with poorly named variables using Codeium's code explanation features. Then, use Codeium to refactor the code to achieve clean code principles.

## Task Instructions

1. **Examine the Provided Code:**
   - Examine the `Sorter` class code provided with poorly named variables.
   - Use Codeium to generate explanations for each method in the class.

2. **Refactor the Code:**
   - Use Codeium to refactor the code and rename variables and methods to achieve clean code principles.
   - Ensure that the refactored code is well-documented and easy to understand.

3. **Add Comments:**
   - Based on Codeium's explanations, add javadoc comments to the code to document its functionality.
   - Ensure each method has a clear explanation of its purpose, parameters, and return value.

4. **Test and Validate:**
   - Create a unit test to test the methods of the `Sorter` class.
