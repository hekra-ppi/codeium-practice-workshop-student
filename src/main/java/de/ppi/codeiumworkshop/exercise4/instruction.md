# Exercise 4: Performance Comparison and Optimization

## Objective

Compare the performance of two different implementations of the factorial calculation (recursive and iterative) using Codeium. Optimize the iterative implementation to improve its runtime.


## Task Instructions

1. **Review the Provided Code:**
   - Examine the `FactorialCalculator` class, which includes two methods for calculating the factorial of a number: `factorialRecursive` and `factorialIterative`.

2. **Compare Performance:**
   - Use Codeium to compare the performance of the two implementations.
   - Write a JUnit test to measure and compare the execution time of both methods for large input values (e.g., `n = 20` and `n = 50`).

### 2. Optimization of the Iterative Implementation

1. **Identify the Performance Bottleneck:**
   - Based on the performance comparison, identify that the iterative method performs worse initially.

2. **Optimize the Iterative Method:**
   - Use Codeium to suggest and implement optimizations for the iterative method.
   - Test the optimized method to ensure it still produces the correct results.

3. **Test and Validate:**
   - Ensure that all tests pass and the optimized iterative method performs better than the original implementation.
