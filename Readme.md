## Introduction

This repository serves as the primary resource center for participants of the Codeium Practice Workshop. During this 1.5-hour session, participants will engage in interactive programming tasks that demonstrate the capabilities of Codeium, including auto-completion, code explanation, error detection, and more.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Install Java 17: Ensure you have Java 17 installed on your system. You can download it from any provider, such as [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/de/temurin/releases/?version=17) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/).
- Install Maven: Maven is necessary for building and running the Java applications. Instructions for installation can be found on the [Maven official website](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).
- Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Download and install from VS Code official website.
- Install Codeium Extension for VS Code: Open VS Code, go to Extensions, search for "Codeium" and install it.
- Get a Free Codeium Account: Sign up for a free Codeium account and familiarize yourself with its basic usage. You can find helpful tutorials and resources on [Codeium University](https://codeium.com/university).


### Clone the Repository

To get started with the exercises, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hekra-ppi/codeium-practice-workshop.git

```

## Workshop Exercises

### Exercise 1: Auto Completion

**Objective:** Implement a Java class `Employee` with properties `name`, `age`, `email`, `position` and `salary`. Utilize Codeium's auto-completion to generate getter and setter methods. Implement additional methods. Override `equals`, `hashcode` and `toString`. 

### Exercise 2: Code Explanation

**Objective:** Analyze and document the functionality of a provided `Sorter` class using Codeium's code explanation and refactoring features.

### Exercise 3: Bug Finding

**Objective:** Identify and fix compile-time and runtime errors in a provided `BankAccountManager` class code snippet using Codeium.

### Exercise 4: Code Optimization

**Objective:** Optimize the code for calculating factorial using Codeium's suggestions for improvements.
